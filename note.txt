data abnormality,
- 0 income lead to infinite number of dti
- dti outlier, dti > 100 ? it's unreasonable.
- annual_inc outlier,

----------------------------------
- recoverie outlier, but it is possible to occure in the real world. but if you want to avoid homoscedasticity, just delete the outlier. recoveries > 10000
- how come there are data with total_rec_prncp = 0 total_rec_prncp = 0 recoveries = 0, but the dataset gave the loan condition? it's magic!

if there is a borrower who cancelled their listing or request for COP or FER, it's not fair some of them got bad credit scoring and the rest of them got good condition?
- total_pymnt and total_rec_prncp and recoveries are variables within the loan period. Normally, we don't have those values when the client applied loan. but it's possible to have those values from previous loan.
